Exercise 1.13.  Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to (Phi^n) / (sqrt 5), where Phi = (1 + (sqrt 5) )/2. 
Hint: Let Psi = (1 - (sqrt 5) )/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section 1.2.2) to prove that 
Fib(n) = (Phi^n - Psi^n) / (sqrt 5).

First of all, if saying fib(n) is the closest integer to (Phi^n) / (sqrt 5), means that abs( fib(n) - ( (Phi^n) / (sqrt 5) ) ) <= 1/2,
then we have abs( Psi^n ) <= (sqrt 5) / 2 need to be proved,
When we can prove abs(Psi) <= 1 and n >= 0 (ofcause it is), we get abs(Psi^n) <= 1.
due to easily result of  1 < (sqrt 5) / 2, we get abs(Psi^n) < (sqrt 5) / 2.
until now, what we have to do is proving that abs(Psi) <= 1 and the hint equation.
